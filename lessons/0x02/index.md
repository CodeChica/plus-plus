      * push and pull
      * branching
      * clone
      * add
      * commit
    * intro to the concept of pull requests and collaborating on code
    * branching - exercise could be a story "once upon a time in a land far far

* Positive Sandwhich! Rule for giving feedback on code.
  * Start with something positive, layer in constructive criticism, end with
    something positive.
