Design is more than just making things look nicer, it's problem solving! Designers play a major role into creating the best user experience possible.

They work with engineers and product teams to define the problem and what features and functions could help solve it.

There are different types of designers in tech. UX Designers focus on how a user interacts with a product and making design choices that are user-centric. UI Designers (User Interface) who focus on the "look and feel" of the website or application such as buttons, pages, anything that the user is interacting with. Product designers combine both the elements of UX and UI design, as they not only look at how the user interacts with the product, but also help determine if the problem at hand is actually being solved and how the design can be improved for scalability in the long term.

They conduct research, create the structure and visual design, wireframes and prototyping, and facilitate user testing.

## What is a Wireframe?

A wireframe is a tool used by designers to create a visual roadmap or blueprint for an application.
They map out where each piece of the feature will live and the overall look and skeletal framework of it.

Wireframes can be created using paper/pencil, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/),
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), or sketched out in ASCII art like the one
below.

Wireframes help us to understand the desired workflow for new features without
spending too much time. It allows us to try different layouts and options before
we start to build them.
